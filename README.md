Ruben Boero's repo for Jeff's security comps Fall 2024. 

More code/project specific documentation can be found in the [ssh-project-code](https://github.com/rubenboero21/cs-comps/tree/main/ssh-project-code) folder.

The [modified-openSSH](https://github.com/rubenboero21/cs-comps/tree/main/modified-openSSH) folder may also be of interest. This folder contains files that we modified from the openSSH implementation in order to help debug our code. More information about what exactly we changed can be found in the README within the [modified-openSSH](https://github.com/rubenboero21/cs-comps/tree/main/modified-openSSH) folder.
