# cs-comps
Ruben Boero's repo for Jeff's security comps Fall 2024. 

Project code and code documentation can be found in the [ssh-project-code](https://github.com/rubenboero21/cs-comps/tree/main/ssh-project-code) folder.

Our project explanation (more general documentation of how an SSH client works) can be found in the BLANK folder.

The [modified-openSSH](https://github.com/rubenboero21/cs-comps/tree/main/modified-openSSH) folder may also be of interest. This folder contains files that we modified from the openSSH implementation in order to help debug our code. More information about what exactly we changed can be found in the README within the [modified-openSSH](https://github.com/rubenboero21/cs-comps/tree/main/modified-openSSH) folder.
