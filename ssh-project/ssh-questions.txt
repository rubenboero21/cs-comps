SSH Questions:

1) We traced through most of the process outlined by RFC using Wireshar, but how should we start to create our own client?
	- Find open source code for ssh client?
	- We can't see everything through Wireshark (some stuff is computer by client/server and not sent between the 2). Is this something that we need to see (source code), or can we just try it on our own?

2) Is the DH key exchange part of the key exchange?
	- Is it normal that we don't see the SSH_MSG_NEWKEYS message until after DH exchange?

3) Why are we seeing an error in our DH exchange?
	- The connection works, so is the error fine to ignore?
