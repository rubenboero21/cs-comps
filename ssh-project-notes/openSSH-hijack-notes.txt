    kexdh.c - called when our client connects to it & we get print out of K
            - handles generation of K
            - hashes the exchange message
    kex.c - called when our client connects - printing exchange hash and session ID
            - hash is printed out from the function that is doing encryption stuff (I think)
                (kex_derive_keys function)
    kexgen.c - prints out the exchange message components
    kexgex.c - no output
    kexgexc.c - no output (bc this is the client version)
    kexgexs.c - no output the server version (idk why this one doesn't work, may not be right function)
    mac.c - printing out info about MAC: key, sequence number, packet info
    packet.c 
        - printing packet len and encrypted packet in ssh_packet_process_incoming
        - ssh_packet_read_poll2 decrypts and does verification
    cipher.c
        - printing cipher context init information
        - Cipher name, encryption mode, key, IV
